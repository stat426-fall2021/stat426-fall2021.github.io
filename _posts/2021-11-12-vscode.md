# IDE

In today's world, coding has become an essential part of us. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, elaborated in the recent Silicon Slope Summit, "Teaching someone to code teaches them critical thinking skills ... coding teaches you the art of the possible ... you need to learn how to code even if you're not going to be a coder." Everyone needs to learn how to code!

As many would agree, the first step to start coding is to choose a language to code in. Once you decide a language to learn, you then get to choose an IDE, the Integrated Development Environment. Having an appropriate IDE can enhance your coding experience and help you become a better coder, in general. Examples of some of the famous IDEs are Xcode, Eclipse, Atom, Sublime Text, Komodo, PyCharm, and Microsoft Visual Studio. Each IDEs are usaully known for its effectiveness on a certain language. For example, Eclipse and Komodo is known for its use with Java, and PyCharm for Python. There are also IDEs that are used for general coding, with extensions to help with specific languages. These include Xcode, Atom, Sublime Text, and Microsoft Visual Studio. 
In case of Microsoft Visual Studio, Microsoft has divided its IDE into two, Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code, to maximize its individual usage. Visual Studio is a "full-featured" and "convenient" development environment mainly for C# and ASP .NET, while Visual Studio Code is a cross-platform (Windows, MacOS, Linux) editor that utilizes extensions/plugins to work with many languages. 
As someone who is very interested in Front-end Web app developing and user experience, I have been using Visual Studio Code for a while, and it is superb. Since Visual Studio Code utilizes plugins, it can also be used with Python and even with Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb).

This post will briefly illustrate how to set up Microsoft Visual Studio Code to work with Python.

# Visual Studio Code vs.
"Why would you use Visual Studio Code instead of other IDEs like Jupyter Notebook or PyCharm?"
Well... I'm just familiar with Visual Studio Code (simply called as VS Code) with my use for web development. You could use any IDE of your choice, but VS Code's UX is very user friendly. It can also do anything Jupyter Notebook can do, except the only bothersome would be that you would have to install more packages compared to Jupyter Notebook. 

# Overview

Well, let's first see an overview of what Visual Studio Code is capable of.

Theme
I would joke with my co-workers saying, "You're not a coder if it's not on dark mode". VS Code offers many pre-built themes that makes it look cool. This doesn't change any functionality, but only the looks.

Terminal
Typing Ctrl + Shift + ` opens up integrated terminal that you can reference to while you work on your project.

Explorer View
The explorer view is phenomenal. It provides a tree-view of the directories. You can easily add another file to the working directory and keep track of it.

# Installation and Set Up
If you are interested, you can go to [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to install VS Code. Once you have Visual Studio installed, you can install extensions by opening the extension tab (Ctrl + Shift + X). You will be able to see a list of extensoins you have installed, which should be none. The packages you need are as the following:
(note: you wouldn't need to download all of it, since it will automatically download dependencies, but I'll leave it in case it doesn't)
    1. Python
    2. Pylance
    3. Jupyter
    4. Jupyter Keymap
    5. Jupyter Notebook Renderers
Once you have all of these, then you're all set! You may create or open a .ipynb file or .py file. In case of working with .py file, if you want to open a kernel, you can type #%% and run.

Note that you will have to install additional packages through the terminal. A safe way of saving packages and running python is through having a local environment, but for this blog's purposes, we'll just install to the public environment. Type in the following on the terminal (Ctrl + Shift + `).

```bash
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install pandas

pip3 install sklearn
// . . .
```

Sklearn requires additional installs. You may follow the prompt given once you run sklearn-related components.

If you need to download anything, or update any existing packages, you can easily open terminal and do so.

# GitHub
A good feature of VS Code is its effectiveness of source control through GitHub. It is good to practice and learn how to use git at the terminal, but once you get used to it, it gets a little bit bothersome to type in everything sometimes.

As you can see, the left pane provides a source control option, where you can type in your commit message and push when needed. Also, the bottom pane indicates whether the repository you are currently working on has updates. You can also easily set up branches and work as a team with VS Code. 

Sometimes, VS Code has many repositories and doesn't save the last repositories you have worked on, not showing all of them. Then, you could go to the directory on your local machine in the terminal to re-instantiate the repository.

```bash
git init
```

# Conclusion
Everyone has different preferences. The main purpose of this blog wasn't to persuade you to use VS Code, but to try an IDE that best fits you. In my case, VS Code works best. For some, having different IDEs for different languages may work better. 

If there are things I could improve on, please don't hesitate to let me know! I'm all ears :)
