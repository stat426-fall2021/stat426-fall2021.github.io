Many disciplines, including statistics, finance, and business, use data visualization to convey information quickly and efficiently to their audience. As such, there are many libraries and packages that have been created to help people make all sorts of plots and graphs. Plotly is a data visualization library that you can use to create beautiful and interactive graphs and is supported in different programing languages such as Python, R, and Julia. It has become a popular library for data visualization because it is easy to implement code, make visually appealing graphics, and the plots are user interactive. These plots are especially useful during exploratory data analysis, where you can create a graphic and then click around and look at individual points. It is also a great tool to share with your audience, who can interact with the graph themselves.

## Installation

If you are using Python, plotly many be installed using pip or pip 3:

```python
pip install plotly
```

Or you can install using conda:

```python
conda install -c plotly plotly=5.3.1
```

## Boxplots

One of the basics of data graphics is the boxplot, which can show the spread of the data at a glance. First, we need to call plotly in our python session. We only need to call the library once at the beginning of our session. The standard way to do this is:


```python
import plotly.express as px
```

Where `< px >` will be the function you use to create graphs. For these examples, I will be pulling data from a data frame that is built into python, so you can try the code out yourselves.  Using the well-known iris dataset built into python, we can create a boxplot at each sepal length of sepal width:

```python
import plotly.express as px
df = px.data.iris()

fig = px.box(df, x="sepal_length", y="petal_length")
fig.show()
```

A graphic like the one above will appear. In your window, you will be able to interact with it by hovering over a single sepal length's boxplot, and it will tell you things like: min, max, q3, q4, and median.

## Bar Graphs

Another basic but important tool in plotly is px.bar, which generates bar graphs. We define the data frame, and then the x and y variables we want to look at. One really cool feature here, is you can add another layer of information to your graph by color-coding it by a third variable. You can do this by using the color argument shown below. In the example code, we color coded by what species the flower is. Plotly will automatically create a legend for what color is what species.

```python
df = px.data.iris()
fig = px.bar(df, x="sepal_width", y="sepal_length", color="species", title="Bar Graph")
fig.show()
```

On the graph, you will be able to hover over each point and see the breakdown of species for each sepal width.

## Scatterplots

Another nice feature you can take advantage of is scatterplots. You use the command `< px.scatter >`, and then define your x and y variables. We again use the color argument to add another level of information to our graph. In the example code, we color coded by the same variable as we did above, which is species.

```python
df = px.data.iris()
fig = px.scatter(df, x="sepal_width", y="sepal_length", color="species", title="A Plotly Express Figure")

fig.show()
```

## Adding a trendline
We can add a trendline to our scatterplot using the `< trendline="ols" >` arguement. It will make a trendline for each species, since we keep the `< color="species" >` argument that we used above.

```python
df = px.data.iris()
fig = px.scatter(df, x="sepal_width", y="sepal_length", color="species", trendline="ols",title="A Plotly Express Figure")

fig.show()
```

## Posting your Plotly Graphic Online

We have gone over a few simple functions in plotly that will create different graphs to look at our dataset. We will be able to interact with the plot ourselves, but what if you want to share your plotly graphic with others with the interaction aspect?

You can do this pretty easily if you have a plotly account. If you don't already have one, make an account with plotly at plot.ly. Then you can install chart_studios with the code below.

```python
pip install chart_studio
```

Then, using the username and api password that you get with your plotly account, run the following code, where fig is the name of the figure you made, and filename is the name you want to give your plot.


```python
import chart_studio
username = '' # your username
api_key = '' # your api key - go to profile > settings > regenerate key
chart_studio.tools.set_credentials_file(username=username, api_key=api_key)

import chart_studio.plotly as py
py.plot(fig, filename = 'Trendline', auto_open=True)
```

After doing this, you should automatically be taken to a link in your account where you can see your interactive graph.

## Conclusion

The plotly library is almost limitless, and can generate almost any kind of chart or plot you can think of. This post is only an introduction into what plotly can do. Some of the other graphs that I think are worth looking into are line charts, pie charts, bubble charts, sankey diagrams, sunburst charts, and many more! There is great documentation beyond this post that you can find on plotly's site that will help you develop your graphic skills. Post below in the comment section examples where you have successfully used plotly, and if possible, attach pictures or code to go with it. It would be especially interesting to see types of graphs that we were not able to cover in this blog post. Good luck!
