**Why was Pandas Created?**

Pandas was created in order to get "better performance" than excel around 2007 by Wes McKinney. 

If you would like to learn more about the history of pandas, refer to this website
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandas_(software)

**How to Install Pandas?**
1. Open up a new terminal window

2. Type in and run "pip install pandas"

If you want to install pandas through the anaconda distribution, refer to this website
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/pandas/

**How to Use Pandas?**
1. Now you can import pandas in your text editor of choice in python
2. Import pandas in the first code chunk and save it as the common alias of pd

If you want to follow along, you can use your own dataset or if you would like to use the same tennis dataset, you can download it here:
https://www.kaggle.com/gmadevs/atp-matches-dataset/version/2?select=atp_matches_2017.csv

Don't forget to have the dataset saved in the same directory as where your python file is located at.

3. The type of the df object is now a pandas DataFrame

4. At this point, you no longer need to explicitly reference the alias pd since we have already loaded the data using pandas. The data is now a pandas object which means we can now use the different features of pandas.
