# Introduction

Although much of the business world relies heavily on programs such as tableau to provide visualization on data analysis, there is a huge advantage to scripting languages such as R and Python to provide customizable plots and figures that clearly represent the data.This blog displays one of the cool uses for ggplot2, as well as helpful methods in bettering your visualization skills.

ggplot2 was created by Hadley Whickam based on the idea of the grammar of graphics. The R package utilizes a system of layering elements and plots to create a final product. There are three main components in every plot. The data, which is the data you want to run through ggplot to create some type of visualization. The aesthetics, which controls certain elements of how the plot looks. And lastly, the geometry, which determines what type of visualization you are going to create with the data.   


## Mapping

#### Heat Maps 

Heat maps are useful in situations where you have data with coordinate points, and you would like to observe the spatial relationship between those points, for some other variable.
geom_tile provides a clean and simple way to create such a heat map. note that your data must be structured in a long format before running it through the geom_tile plot. The fill argument determines which variable will be used to color the map.

`ggplot(data, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude)) + geom_tile(aes(fill = variable))`
  
#### Geographical Maps

Taking a step further, you can also produce geographical maps of the observations if they are categorized by something like region, country, or state. To demonstrate this, we will be using a dataset that contains the Gross Domestic Product of each country in the year 2017. 

The first step is to extract the coordinates of your locations using the map_data function, which is part of the maps package. To extract the coordinates of all countries, the input "world" is used. However, there are other options such as "state" which produces the coordinates for the United States. This code produces the latitude and longitude of each country, and then the code is joined to our original data. Using geom_polygon, we can then plot the map with the values filled in for each country.

`install.packages(maps)`\
`library(maps)`\
`map <- map_data("world")`\
`data <- lef_join(map, data, by = "region")`\
`map_plot <- ggplot(map_data, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) + geom_polygon(aes(fill = GDP), color = "black")`

## Customization

Creating small changes in a plot can have a significant impact in the readability of the plot for your viewers. There are some important methods to make plots more pleasing to the eye and more concise in presenting the information. Using the above plot that we created, lets discuss some ways to customize the plot to our liking.

#### creating subtitles

Titles are commonly used in ggplot2, however subtitles can useful as well when more information needs to be provided. Subtitles are easy to include, and have a similar format to adding a title.

`map_plot <- map_plot + labs(title = "World GDP", 
        subtitle = "GDP of each country in the year 2017 in billions of dollars")`


#### changing the theme

One way to make a plot stand out is to change the theme from the default ggplot2 setting. ggplot2 has some useful default themes that can be utilized by using the line theme_ and the theme title.

`map_plot + theme_dark()`

Using the ggthemes package, other more customized themes can also be used. All that is required is to include the chosen theme as a function at the end of the plot.

`install.packages("ggthemes")`\
`library(ggthemes)`\
`map_plot + theme_fivethirtyeight()`


#### changing the color scheme

This line of code creates a new spectrum of colors to use in the plot instead of the default range, where these colors are chosen between the low and high specified. The name element also changes the legend title of the plot. Conveniently, this line can be added to the end of any ggplot to establish the change. By changing the colors of the plot, it is easier to see the variation in GDP between countries.

`map_plot + scale_fill_gradient(name = "GDP", low = "white", high = "red")`

#### Removing elements

Often in data visualization, less really is more. To remove elements of a plot such as the axis titles and tick marks, simply use the element_blank function inside the theme of the plot. This can help the viewer to focus on the important information, and not on details that do not provide any value. 

`map_plot + theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
       axis.text.y = element_blank(),
       axis.title.x = element_blank(),
       axis.title.y = element_blank(),
       axis.ticks = element_blank())`

#### Including Images

Especially in business, it is common to include company logos or images in presentations. It is also possible to include images that overlap with your plot using the cowplot and magick packages, where x and y specify where the image should be placed, and scale indicates the size. The file path can be a url as shown below or to a local file.

`install.packages("cowplot")`\
`library(cowplot)`\
`install.packages("magick")`\
`library(magick)`\
`ggdraw() + draw_plot(map_plot) + draw_image("https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/logo.png", x = .3, y = .3, scale = .2)`

## Conclusion

After you have created your plots, it is easy to save them as png files by executing the following code. The first function calls the plot that has most recently been modified, while the second saves it to your desired name. 

`last_plot()`\
`ggsave(“map_plot.png”, width = 5, height = 5)`

Ultimately there are endless possibilities for creating the plot that you want through ggplot2. The important thing is to always be learning new and unique ways that ggplot2 can increase your fluency and skill in data visualization.
